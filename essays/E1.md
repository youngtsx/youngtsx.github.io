On BrowserHistory1, I had a pretty solid understanding of how to format the basic html with the paragraph sections and styling before starting. I made sure to be thorough in reading the instructions before I started. After that, I reviewed the technical details like how to add internal and external links. I redid this assignment 3 times to the end because I was getting confused on the links. BrowserHistory2 was tricky because I messed up the margins by adding commas so I had to restart. I had a lot of trouble connecting the google font link for some reason. BrowserHistory3 was the hardest for me, I had to watch the screencast and work through it before recording it. 

Even though I had to redo these multiple times, I always finished before restarting because repetition is helpful for memorization. I often talked through it to remember what did what. Just doing the reading isnâ€™t sufficient for the information to stick in my head.
