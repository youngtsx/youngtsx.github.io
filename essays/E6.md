## Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
My system is a store that sells boba like milk tea, fruit tea, and smoothies. There is also a small selection of cakes.
## Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
A notable shortcoming is the favorites didn’t work well, didn’t toggle checked or not, and would display all the items in the array before it even if they weren’t checked. 
## Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
I am most proud that it is actually working, all features are implemented. The add to favorites works though not as good as expected.
## Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I’m least happy with some of the css and displayed things. I compromised on areas such as the email invoice and favorites table. It looks ugly but does the job.
## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
It took even more time but with so much less code. Even the add to favorites which I thought was going to be incredibly drawn out and difficult was quite short.
## When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I spent a lot of time working through problems. I was coming at all angles when things didn’t work. If there were error messages I had to stop and think about what it means and where it's coming from.
## Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
I think using sessions worked well for me and implementing the code examples worked very well for me.
## Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
The IR4 as described above.
## What did you learn from doing this assignment?
I learned that loadjson can also send data and not just receive.
## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I’d probably bother Professor Port way earlier.
## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
20% thinking
30%writing
50%debugging
