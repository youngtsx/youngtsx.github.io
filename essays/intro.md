Hi, my name is Tiffany Young and I am very excited and nervous to start my first MIS course.

I spent a lot of time searching for things that I would like to pursue as a career. I'd land on something interesting and then change it days later. I thought programming was interesting but I wasn't comfortable jumping into something so difficult with no experience. My initial fixation was on marketing so I did want to do something business related. I was and still am addicted to my computer so I finally landed here as a MIS major.
